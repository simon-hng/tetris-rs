# AI-written Rust Tetris

A terminal-based Tetris implementation written in Rust using the `ratatui` library. This project was created through AI pair programming using Claude Sonnet (Anthropic) with minimal human intervention.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the capabilities of AI-assisted development, combining:
- Rust's performance and safety features
- Ratatui's powerful terminal UI capabilities 
- AI-driven development workflow

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **UI Framework**: Ratatui (Terminal UI)
- **Development Approach**: AI pair programming with Claude Sonnet

## AI Collaboration Process

The entire codebase was developed through an interactive process where:
1. Human developer provided high-level requirements and context
2. Claude Sonnet generated code implementations
3. Human developer reviewed and validated the code
4. Iterative improvements were made through AI-human dialogue

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay in your terminal
- Smooth piece movement and rotation
- Score tracking
- Next piece preview
- Clean, modular Rust code
- Cross-platform terminal support

## Running the Game

```bash
cargo run
```
